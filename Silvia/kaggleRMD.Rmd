```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r cars}
setwd("/Users/lujian/Desktop/Kaggle")
library(VIM)
library(mice)
library(dplyr)
train = read.csv("train.csv")
train = train[,-81]
test = read.csv('test.csv')

full = rbind(train,test)

aggr(full)
md.pattern(full)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
