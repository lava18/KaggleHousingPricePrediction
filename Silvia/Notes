Garage: 
For two data points in the test set, there is some information missing with the garage. 
For these two houses, they have a garage. Further imputation can be attempted if needed. 
For now, I will impute them as 0, as not having a garage. 

Basement:
same thing happens to basement too. There are some data points where there is a basement but 
some data are missing for this basement. For now, I will impute those datapoints as not
having a basement. Further imputation shall be attempted if needed. 

Exterior 1st and 2nd:
Since those are nominal values for further one-hot coding, I will aggregate these two columns into one. 
For now, I will leave them out. 
There is only one missing value for the two variables, it is the same house. I am thinking replacing those
values with the most frequent category. Further attempt shall be implemented. 

Masonry veneer type and area:
for houses with none type, the area is 0. 
However, for houses with NA, the area is also NA. 
I will think of this as completely missing at random, will replace the NA values with the most frequent
category and maybe the mean of that category to replace the numeric values. 

Pool Quality:
For pool quality, most of the NAs have a 0 pool area, however, 3
of the missing values have a greater than 0 pool area. Those data points
should not be imputed to none. Instead, they should be imputed to some categories with 
careful selection. The ids are 2420, 2503, 2599.
